      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am currently studying to become a software developer, with a focus on building skills in coding, problem-solving, and application development. I am passionate about creating innovative solutions and continuously enhancing my technical expertise in programming languages, software architecture, and system design. 
        
        Prior to transitioning into IT, I completed my studies in Paralegal Studies. Through this, I gained valuable experience in legal research, document drafting, and case management. My paralegal background has sharpened my analytical thinking, attention to detail, and ability to work under pressureâ€”skills that seamlessly complement my journey into software development. I am enthusiastic about combining my diverse skill set to bring unique perspectives to the tech industry, particularly in areas like legal technology, compliance, or any opportunity that leverages both my technical and legal expertise.</p>
