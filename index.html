      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am currently studying to become a software developer, with a focus on
        building skills in coding, problem-solving, and application development.
        I am passionate about creating innovative solutions and continuously
        enhancing my technical expertise in programming languages, software
        architecture, and system design. Prior to transitioning into IT, I
        completed my studies in Paralegal Studies. Through this, I gained
        valuable experience in legal research, document drafting, and case
        management.My paralegal background has sharpened my analytical thinking,
        attention to detail, and ability to work under pressure—skills that
        seamlessly complement my journey into software development. I am
        enthusiastic about combining my diverse skill set to bring unique
        perspectives to the tech industry, particularly in areas like legal
        technology, compliance, or any opportunity that leverages both my
        technical and legal expertise.
